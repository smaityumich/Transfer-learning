# Classifier for target-shift setup
### No labels observed in target distribution (Ref: Lipton et al.)


## Simulation Results
Look at the output.target.shift.nolabel.ipynb for the simulation results

### Simulation procedure steps

- $x_s, y_s$ contains $m$ many data from the source distribution $P\equiv $



## Efficiency 
Efficiency of the algorithm is given in cprofile-without-label-classifier.out file

- cProfile package is used to test the efficiency
